## Assignment 1: “Manim Error-Fixing Pipeline with AI”

### Goal:

Build a small pipeline where an AI model iteratively fixes Manim code until it runs successfully and produces a video.

### Problem Statement:

 The system takes as input a text prompt describing a scene, then:

1. Generates Python code for Manim (e.g., using OpenAI or Gemini API).
2. Attempts to run it.
3. If an error occurs, captures the error message and asks the AI to fix the code.
4. Repeats until the code executes successfully and produces a .mp4 video.

### Example Flow:


Prompt → “Create a rotating cube with labels on each face”

→ AI generates Manim code.
→ Run code → Error → Capture traceback.
→ Send both code + error to AI for correction.
→ Re-run until success.
→ Output: final working Manim video.


### 🧰 Tech Stack:

* Node.js and Typescript
* Manim (Community edition) 
* OpenAI/Gemini API - use gemini free tier api.
* Docker (bonus if they containerize)

* Optional: small web UI to visualize iterations

### ✅ Evaluation Criteria:

| Criteria           | Description                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Core Logic     | Working retry/fix loop                                |
| Error Handling | Ability to parse errors and fix logically             |
| Efficiency     | Number of correction iterations before success        |
| Code Quality   | Clean modular code, clear flow                        |
| Bonus          | Logging, async execution, or small frontend dashboard |
